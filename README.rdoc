Art Collector is an app geared towards educators and students, as well as anyone who has an interest in art and a story to tell.  The user can write their story and easily drop images into it for a robust story telling experience.

Future implementations will include APIs from various museums for more images and content to further enhance the stories; adding a member component so users can easily share their stories with their Art Collector community; Google Maps to show where in the world pieces of art are currently displayed so the user can visit it; the ability to show images from a story as a separate slideshow for presentations to larger audiences.

Build with HTML5/CSS3/SASS, Ruby, Rails, Paperclip gem, Shortcode gem, APIs, and Bourbon/Neat/Refills.
